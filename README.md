# r-test-matplotlib

The goal of **r-test-matplotlib** is testing that Python `matplotlib` works seamlessly from within `RStudio`.

## Motivation
Making `matplotlib` run from within RStudio using the R package `reticulate` and **Python Anaconda** has improved a lot in the past few months. The package `reticulate` and RStudio have gone through a thoroug transformation and now is an accepted fact that Python and R have to liv along.


## Examples
I have included some working examples of Rmarkdown notebooks with Python `matplotlib` plots.
